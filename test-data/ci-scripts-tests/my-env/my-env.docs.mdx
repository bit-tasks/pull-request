## Use in existing workspaces

Add the development env to your generator configuration on `workspace.jsonc`.  

```json
{
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "envs": [
      "my-scope/my-env"
    ]
  }
}
```

You can see the generator templates in your workspace using `bit templates`.

## Use on an existing component

Use this dev environment on your existing components, by running the following command: 

```
bit env set my-component my-scope/my-env
```


## Create a React workspace

You can create a new React workspace made from this env using the following command:

```
bit new react my-workspace --aspect my-scope/my-env
```

## Compose your own env

You can base on this env, and customize it to your needs. To create your env run this command:
```
bit create react-env my-new-env
```

Make sure your new environment class extends this env class and overrides the needed class methods.
