/**
 * The Bitmap file is an auto generated file used by Bit to track all your Bit components. It maps the component to a folder in your file system.
 * This file should be committed to VCS(version control).
 * Components are listed using their component ID (https://bit.dev/reference/components/component-id).
 * If you want to delete components you can use the "bit remove <component-id>" command.
 * See the docs (https://bit.dev/reference/components/removing-components) for more information, or use "bit remove --help".
